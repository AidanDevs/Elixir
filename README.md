# Elixir
Elixir is a cheap and open-source Training FMS system for First Robotics Competition.
It runs off of arduino's and is meant to be a cheap solution for teams to use during drive practice.
It shows the driver their score after completing a mock match with just themselves (ALthough you can practice being defended with your teams bots from previous years).
